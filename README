# My Story Project

This is an introductory project for the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, according to a design brief. It contains cards illustrating essential components that make up who I am. I have the great appreciation for movies, travel, reading, coding, and most importantly, family!

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

## Plan on improving the project

Add animation to flip cards. The back of cards will contain questionnare boxes allowing users to ask questions on each topic including, but not limited to, my favorite books and movies.
