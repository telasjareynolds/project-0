            Traveling is my favorite hobby! The goal is to vacation at least
            twice a year. I also have a bachelors in Film Production and
            although I've chosen a different field, I'll always appreciate a
            cinematic experience.

            There's no better escape from reality than getting lost in a good
            series! I've shamelessly re-read some of my favorites at least 4
            times.

            The passion I have for coding is exhilarating. Starting each day by
            learning something new, as well as being able to bring creations to
            life, will continue to fulfill me.

            My son, August, is the most precious aspect of my life. I've
            recently bought a house and being able to simply watch him play on
            the swingset in the backyard of our very own place is an
            unexplainable feeling. Being is mom will forever be my greatest
            accomplishment.
